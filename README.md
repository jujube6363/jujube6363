## Featured Project: [Fruit^3](https://github.com/jujube6363/319_fruitcubed)
### What We Did: 
**Software:** Developed an original, bilingual, video game with advanced features such as collision detection and sounds produced through a DAC on an MSPM0 microcontroller in Code Composer Studio and C++.

**Hardware:** Designed a PCB layout in KiCAD to serve as the controller and soldered core componentsâ€“ LEDs, switches, LCD, slidepot, resistors, and an audio jackâ€“ onto the PCB
### Tools: 
C/C++, Code Composer Studio, KiCAD, Soldering
### Video Demonstration: [Fruit^3 Demo](https://youtu.be/g4-pJ8HqwUU?si=i5hVvLDM9YQ81SO2)

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack:
### Languages: C, C++, Python, Verilog, C#, Java, MATLAB, ARM Assembly, SQL
### Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-learn
### Tools: Colab, GitHub, VS Code, LTSpice, KiCAD

## ðŸš€ More Projects:
### 1. [RaceCare Hackathon Project](https://github.com/jujube6363/RacecarHackathon)
- We devised a project to solve the real-world issue of patients suffering from paralysis or limited mobility by gamifying rehabilitation exercises with a racing-themed twist.
- We won the Best Novice Award at the [2024 Formula Hacks Hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/racecare-super-mender-bros).
- Learnings: C#, Unity Game Engine, Arduino
- 
### 2. [Rolling Notes Hackathon Project](https://github.com/jujube6363/Record-Hacks)
- We created a rhythm game that translated inputs from external hardware to real-time LED display and in-game notes, allowing users to hit combos in a fun and interactive way.
